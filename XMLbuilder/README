This is a very hard coded way to build an XML file from a text file. 
This will probably only be used to create levels for our Project 2 only.  

Note to group members: 
Height of the game screen is 20 boxes so account for each line for the height.
Width is 30, but you can exceed that to have the scroll effect. 
Actually just double it by a lot. Build it so it actually looks like the level.
(See below for more details).

       ---------LEGEND --------
       | x = normal blocks    | 
       | c = cake             |
       | t = trap blocks      |
       | p = passable blocks  |
       | d = bouncy blocks    |
       ------------------------

Any character not stated above represents a space.  
We can also add more attributes later -- like moving platforms, visible/nonvisible 
spikes/etc. 

Here is the current conversion from our tiles to our game window (width x height) : 
                      (30 x 20) = 960 x 640. 
If you want a bigger map, repeat it so the math will be simple for the setBoundaries method.
Example: In the LevelTester2, I made it so it's (960*3 x 640).
Or I can just tweak this code to account for the setBoundaries -- we'll discuss this later. 

Example of the text file (30x20 -- standard game window size):

More examples: 
test.txt for the input file (30*3 x 20 aka 960*3 x 640)
LevelOutput.XML for the generated XML file.
